<h1>Community Service</h1>
<p>Whether it's helping an elderly home-owner with house repairs at Christmas in April, assisting with children's programs
at the library, or serving meals to the needy at the Friendship Table, the Bradford Kiwanis Club is active throughout the 
community.</p> <p>Emphasis on children and youth is reflected in many of the Bradford Kiwanis Club's annual Christmas
Party for the Children at Beacon Light Behavioral Health Systems is a tradition that dates from the founding of the club in
1936. Kiwanis sponsorship of the Key Club at Bradford Area High School dates from 1948. </p><br/> <p>Community service extends across
a broad range of needs. You'll find Kiwanians delivering flowers during the American Cancer Society's Daffodil Days, ringing
the bell at the Salvation Army Christmas kettles, volunteering at Special Olympics events, and serving meals at 
	the Friendship
	table.The Kiwanis Club often lends a hand to help stage civic events, improve parks and playgrounds, and provide volunteers at
countless projects.</p>

<h1>Kiwanis Kapers</h1>

<p>The Kiwanis Club of Bradford is proud of its tradition of combining fun with community
 service.  This is evident in the “Kiwanis Kapers,” the club’s annual variety show 
 fundraiser, which turns 56 this year!
</p><br/>

<p> Every year since 1957, members of the club have organized a stage show using local 
amateur talent.  Kiwanians participate on-stage as well as behind the scenes in the club’s 
only fundraiser. </p> <br/>

<p> Over the years, the show has taken many different forms, from musical stage shows to 
variety.  Themes have ranged from Broadway to mystery to parodies of popular entertainment.
Whatever the format, Kiwanis Kapers is a much anticipated local tradition with emphasis on
family entertainment.</p><br/>

<p> Kapers is a lot of fun, not just for our club, but for the entire community. 
We are able to showcase all kinds of wonderful talent and provide an enjoyable 
evening of live entertainment.</p><br/>

<p> Kapers always has strong support from the community, especially patrons and program 
advertisers, who ensure that our show will be a financial success. </p><br/>

<p>The Bradford Kiwanis Club is know throughout the state for its "Kapers"
production with fellow Kiwanians traveling to enjoy the show. In fact, the
"Kapers" production is often the topic of discussion at the Kiwanis Mid-Winter
and Summer Conferences</p><br/>

<p> Last year’s show, “Working 9 to 5,” featured vocal groups, jazzy dance numbers, 
singers, a children’s number, high school percussion composition, University of Pittsburgh at Bradford
Improvers, and comedy which had the audience roaring with approval. Proceeds from Kiwanis Kapers are used to 
support a wide range of charitable causes, with special emphasis on children’s programs.</p><br/>

<p> Plans are well underway for the 50th anniversary show, which will feature highlights from
past years, along with exciting new material.  Why not plan a trip to Bradford, PA, November 9,
10, and 11 to be part of a Kiwanis tradition that has spanned 56 years!
